# debiased-classifier
Code for a project on unbiasing a classifier.
Currently contains an implementation of 'Censoring Representations with an Adversary', Harrison Edwards and Amos Storkey, ICLR 2016.
Future work to come :)

## Dependencies
You should be using python 3.
To run, you will need 'tensorflow, numpy,' and 'pandas'.

To install tensorflow, follow the tutorial here:
https://www.tensorflow.org/install/
(This will also get you numpy in the process.)
I recommend installing in a virtualenv (the installation tutorial elaborates on this further).

To install pandas, follow this tutorial: 
https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/install.html

Then you should be ready!
